            <p>
              The wheel has often been the symbol of technological
              advancement.<br />It represents humanity's realization of its
              ability to think up and actualize things that weren't in the
              nature.<br />At the same time, it marks the beginning of
              humanity's transformation into prideful creatures.<br />That might
              be why pride takes the form of a wheel.<br />The steel circle
              doesn't ever seem to stop rotating.<br />It doesn't care if it
              gashes at flesh or crushes patches of grass.<br />Because, it can
              roll…<br />While others cannot.

              It happened while I was passing by a jungle.<br />It was a dense
              green wilderness full of tall flowers and trees, as well as
              outlandish bees and butterflies.<br />You can find all kinds of
              unfathomably strange creatures in a place like that.<br />For
              example... That flower.<br />It's said that a plant can't normally
              move on its own. One it takes root, it stays there for the rest of
              its life.<br />That's what people consider a major difference
              between plants and animals.<br />But those "plants" were like a
              pack of rabid beasts.<br />A group of them charged at us, raising
              their teethed flowers like it was their head.<br />Their roots
              morphed into limbs that no longer serve the original purpose, and
              there didn't seem to be any space in their bodies for storing
              nutrients.<br />Yet, those scrawny stems were hungrily seeking the
              missing sustenance.<br />Continuously shoving things into the
              mouth, despite being unable to absorb any of it...<br />What an
              odd creature that was.

              It resembled a rock.<br />I am uncertain how an object of its mass
              is able to move. Its appearance could not be any less adherent to
              laws of science, but when I look back, it might have been an
              inherently scientific object after all.<br />It would levitate in
              the air and stay still.<br />It rolled its eyeball lodged in the
              center. And when it felt like it, it would ram into some
              persons.<br />I am not yet sure what motivates it to move. Even
              so, I wonder if it's necessary to learn its reasons at all.<br />It's
              possible that this pebble is alive.<br />No one would call it an
              organism, but by the same token, I may not be alive if no one
              refers to me as such.<br />Perhaps it was simply a matter of
              laziness.<br />We were lazy to think that it mustn't be what it
              thought to be.<br />That pebble is probably a lazy living
              being.<br />And the same could be said of me.

              You want me to talk about that pointed thing, aye?<br />Thing's

              poor sods with its long snout, and... It starts shooting that red
              water into the body!<br />It gives me a heartburn like I had some
              hard stuff on an empty stomach... 's irritating...and
              suffocating...<br />A-Anyway, it makes you feel all weird. Makes

              Recording the information gained from an encounter with the
              entity.<br />&lt;Company Rules&gt; Article 11, Paragraph 2 states
              that I am to categorize it as an Abnormality.<br />When first
              faced with the Sinners, the Abnormality showed no signs of
              hostility. Instead, it initiated direct communication through the
              psyche.<br />Out of all the languages I knew, the Abnormality
              appeared to use my most commonly spoken one. I did not see any
              sound-producing organs such as the mouth or vocal cords in
              motion.<br />“Bring Snow White.” This is what the Abnormality
              said. A report on the former L Corp. I analyzed after
              disengagement suggests that it has a connection with F-04-42.<br />In
              addition, I discovered a corpse that seemed to belong to the staff
              that arrived here before us for preliminary investigation. Their
              ID confirmed that they were from the Operations Planning
              department, so we retrieved the remains and left the scene before
              a battle could break out.<br />Concluding the report.

            <h2>Observation Level 1</h2>
            <p>
              Recording the information gained from encountering the entity in
              battle.<br />&lt;Company Rules&gt; Article 11, Paragraph 3 states
              that I am to designate its risk level as WAW. This is based on the
              managerial procedures retrieved from the branch facility.<br />I
              will describe its behavior during combat.<br />It attacks using
              growths of vines. It wraps its vines around itself as well,
              forming a shape that resembles a dress; it is possible that it
              believes itself to be a “noble”.<br />Its vines are used in a
              variety of ways, such as persistently stabbing one Sinner and
              rising from the floor to injure multiple Sinners.<br />In
              addition, its sturdy exterior made it difficult to damage.<br />In
              one battle where many Sinners were lost, we managed to remove one
              of its arms. (As I could most aptly describe.) I found then that
              it could no longer perform the attack that targeted every
              Sinner.<br />I will record any additional discoveries I observe in
              future encounters.<br />Concluding the report.

            <h2>Observation Level 2</h2>
            <p>
              Recording an additional significant discovery.<br />We were able
              to remove its head during an encounter.<br />While we did not
              initially consider the head a target as its height was
              considerably higher than the Sinners’ reach, Heathcliff’s
              unstoppable advance provided a helpful clue.<br />We were able to
              successfully destroy the head. Although Heathcliff’s head was
              destroyed as well, it should be a negligible loss as it is a
              renewable asset.<br />It continued to move and attack despite the
              lack of a head, but we found that its exterior significantly
              softened.<br />Removing its “limbs” became a much more manageable
              task.<br />Even though the head grew back after a period of time,
              the removal of its arms and legs in the meantime freed us from the
              threat of powerful attacks for the rest of the operation.<br />Concluding
              the report.

              I was ordered to describe facts about this in detail.<br />So I
              observed.<br />Placed on a wooden pedestal that seemed as though
              it was woven from fibers of muscles was a large stone plate.<br />As

              my colleagues strongly discouraged me from doing so, so I turned
              away.<br />One thing I can say with confidence is that it was
              likely a tool for predicting a date of some kind, judging from the
              many letters carved on the bricks.<br />Such is all I have to

              I had an opportunity to engage it in combat.<br />Though it may
              have been less than pleasant as an observer to see the object of
              study sustain damage, more discoveries could be had in the
              behaviors it displayed during battle.<br />It summoned a number of
              flesh dolls wearing stone masks made of what I believe is the same
              mineral as the plate.<br />By 'offering' these dolls to the plate,
              I was able to observe a change in its shape.<br />The rattling
              bricks gradually widened, and I could see red muscle fibers and
              strange spatial extensions...or such.<br />I can't say for sure
              how drastic the change will be, but an observable trend is that
              it's becoming more and more ominous.<br />Such is all I have to
              say.<br /><span id="heathcliff"

              I had an opportunity to be offered to this.<br />I am about to
              describe the disconcerting, wet, and abnormal experience here.<br />I
              took unwavering steps forward as the choice was reasonable. I had
              no reason to fear, for I would be brought back to life even if I
              were to perish.<br />I did not feel the death, so to speak. Though
              I have experienced death many times in battle, I was not subjected
              to the sort of pain or flashing disarray that normally accompanies
              a demise that time. It simply felt as though I was being
              transported to a different location.<br />It may be the universe
              or some other dimension.<br />My own body and voice couldn't be
              perceived by my senses. Perhaps my eyes had gone and I became part
              of that place.<br />There, I may have seen the end. You could say
              it was a doomsday I witnessed.<br />No perhaps I may have been the
              end and the doomsday I was present at the end but not existent and
              while it may be misleading to say that it was there but even still
              I witnessed man and sky and earth tear into thousands of pieces<br />[The

              Abnormality.<br />It wore a mask that resembled a crude diver's
              helmet. It appeared to be made of a stone with high hardness, its
              exterior well polished.<br />Correction: rather than polished, it
              appears to have been "made that way". I was unable to detect any
              signs of artificial processing.<br />Its body resembled muscle
              fibers. The lack of skin or other protective surface makes it
              appear highly fragile, but a large number of these entities are
              expected to be more difficult to deal with.<br />Concluding the

              I encountered the entity in battle.<br />&lt;Company Rules&gt;
              Article 11, Paragraph 3 states I am to designate its risk level as
              TETH.<br />I will describe its behavior during combat.<br />The
              entities appear to use their thin yet elastic body for quick
              attacks.<br />They often charged into Sinners and grabbed their
              target tight. They were difficult to remove, and a few lives were
              lost due to their persistence.<br />As stated in the previous
              report, the entity appears to be closely related to the stone
              plate Abnormality. When the entities were killed and 'offered' to
              the stone plate Abnormality, a change in the plate's shape could
              be observed.<br />In addition, the masks of these entities
              gradually changed accordingly.<br />Faust is curious. I should
              make it my next task to study the extent of this
              transformation.<br />Concluding the report.<br /><span

            <h2>Observation Level 2</h2>
            <p>
              I observed the full extent of its changes.<br />Its mask had two
              forms it could assume.<br />While not as impressive as the four
              states the stone plate Abnormality could take, there was an
              undeniable connection between them.<br />It seems to be able to
              generate fire from within the mask. An autopsy after battle
              revealed no combustible materials stored inside, suggesting that
              the fire was not created via physical means.<br />No further
              discoveries were made.<br />...A shame, Faust was hoping to learn

              off-topic there. Anyway, that apple was golden. Definitely not

              it's not a bad idea to write down my experiences. I hated when my
              grandfather scolded and pestered me into keeping a diary, but now,
              I'm not so averse to the thought.<br />So, I have to describe the
              appearance of that Abnormality, right?<br />Firstly... Its eyes
              were out of focus. It was drooling from the mouth, too.<br />Something
              about the color of the eyes and the saliva was off as well. They
              were all pink, same as the ribbon wrapped around the body.<br />Oh,
              speaking of ribbons, doesn't it bear a striking resemblance to
              silk?<br />I think our family kept a similar color of fabric.
              Though it wasn't the most luxurious... Hm, I do guess it's
              valuable in its own right.<br />Right, that's it! We used
              something like this for decoration on our younger sibling's
              birthday!

              it with words.<br />Oh... I wouldn't have taken interest in dead
              bodies in the first place, now that I think about it.<br />Could

            <p>
              The white-haired lass keeps bugging me, but I'm writing this my
              way. These buggers spat on me mood enough in the fight today.<br />Those
              goggling eyeballs... Right, those things weren't actually clay.<br />Muscles...
              That's got to be it, muscles. Ripping one of those gave me the
              same feeling as tearing up an unlucky sod.<br />Seemed like those
              bundles of muscles sticking to the limbs were what's moving the
              body, acting like the whole thing belongs to 'em. The eyes on the
              face never flinched, only the ones on the arms.<br />Made it a bit
              tricky to fight 'em. I'm supposed to guess where it'll go next
              based on where it's looking, but that eye thing kept throwing me
              off. Well, I don't mind taking a hit too much if I can skelp 'em
              three times in return.<br />Another thing… Those things looked
              like they had feelings. Their muscles quivered each time I hit
              'em. Squinted their eyes, too… Like it was getting mad.<br />Some
              clatty fruitcake they are.<br /><span id="ryoshu"

              Normally, things like these grow back right as we break 'em, but
              those muscle lumps don't seem too good at that.<br />I doggedly
              bashed the big chunk o' muscles stuck to an arm, and I managed to
              crush it fine.<br />That didn't stop it from trying and hitting
              me, though… It didn't threaten me as much, but that didn't mean
              not much at all.<br />Right, I think it no longer did the thing
              where it gets right fuming and grabs one o' us to tear 'em off.<br />Yeah,
              it only makes sense, can't do the stabbing if that big knife's
              broken.

              Those things are too quick. Their reaction speed is clearly above
              average human level.<br />They've got wits, too. Rather than
              jumping in recklessly...<br />They use the tactic of striking at
              the weakest target in the back lines before quickly running
              away.<br />It happened in our last encounter with them, too; when
              you ordered a badly injured Sinner to fall back, those things
              jumped at them to scratch open an atery and ran off like the wind

              remember you going through a lot of trouble last time when you
              tried dealing with all of them at the same time and got us all
              killed. It's as if they grow stronger the more they're
              attacked.<br />Ah, speaking of my death...<br />It brings me back
              to the moment when those things chewed up my intestines.<br />I
              think I died before I could feel the pain, but somehow... I felt
              as though I was falling into an endless pit of fire.<br />It
              wasn't hot or searing, just...<br />Being with the fire felt oddly
              natural.<br />I guess it's a good thing I was brought back before
              I experienced more of that. My thanks go to the manager.

              I'm...<br />I'm, still scared of Kromer.<br />Looking at her face
              makes my face twitch, and her blade gives me the chills.<br />Her
              maniacal eyes remind me of the tragedy on Christmas, and her
              creepy grin still has my eyes quivering.<br />But...<br />But I'm
              okay now.<br />I can stand up to her whistles now.<br />The things
              she's done are too vile for me to stand by, and I'd be too ashamed
              to see the Sinners she's killed if I let that bitch go.<br />I've
              changed a lot since then.<br />I've died a lot of deaths, and
              claimed a lot of lives.<br />I can go mad all the same now.<br />So,
              I will for sure…<br />I'll skewer her chest with a stake, over and

              When I think about it, Kromer always had an obsession with
              flesh.<br />And that obsession cumulated into what we're seeing
              now... A gruesome creature.<br />At first... I agreed with her.
              The idea of replacing the flesh with something else was unpleasant
              to me.<br />But now I see. What's really unpleasant...is believing
              that your thought is the only correct one...and letting that
              thought consume your mind whole.

              I will describe my impressions of the encounter with this.<br />It
              has the appearance of three dark-furred wolves stitched together
              in a delicate operation. No, there may have been more, as it
              possessed more than three mouths.<br />Atop the canine heads was
              the figure of a person, charred beyond recognition. Though a
              combustion of that degree normally would have reduced such a
              figure to ashes, its form was as solid as it could be, its muscles
              even showing motion.<br />In addition, a heap of wooden telephone
              poles are lodged into the wolves' body as stakes would a prisoner.
              They seem to periodically emit electricity, but I couldn't fathom
              through what means they were able to do so.<br />Such is all I
              have to say.
            </p>
            <h2>Observation Level 1</h2>
            <p>
              I had an opportunity to engage it in combat.<br />It ran at me,
              galloping in a possessed motion.<br />Its visage was a far cry
              from a hound commanded to battle or a beast yearning to feed
              itself.<br />Running at me may have been its only choice.<br />I
              saw a purple arc of electricity sprint across its back. Which
              reminded me of animals tested under similar conditions in the
              laboratory.<br />Using electric stimuli, those animals were made
              to move as some other being intended.<br />It made me wonder if
              the same is happening to this creature.<br />While its claws hurt
              me gravely, I felt an ounce of pity for it as well.<br />Such is
              all I have to say.
            </p>
            <h2>Observation Level 2</h2>
            <p>
              It had a thunderous roar.<br />To describe it in more detail, it
              gathered bolts of lightning as if all the storms and thunders in
              the world struck it at once, so it wouldn't be an exaggeration to
              say that its roar has a thunderous property.<br />Naturally, I was
              able to identify the source of its electricity.<br />This creature
              was like a living battery. Collecting lightning in its body, it
              used the power to fuel itself.<br />Alas, its usage of the
              lightning's energy was not for a self-motivated purpose such as
              pursuit of strength;<br />the accumulated electric forces appeared
              to dictate its motion, giving me the impression that it was the
              will of the sky that it followed.<br />While drawing up such
              thoughts, Miss Faust reminded me that it's not right to have such
              impressions of Abnormalities.<br />Thus, I conclude the log here
              lest it becomes too sentimental.

              It wasn't the most pleasant encounter.<br />You might say that
              this would apply to facing any Abnormality in battle, but this one
              just...felt unusual, somehow.<br />It was sitting languidly still

              with no confidence...<br />Yeah. It was kinda getting on my

              I think I've learned one thing.<br />I don't know how it came to
              attack its foes with its own eyeballs, but it looks like getting
              hit by it drains your energy (on top of it being incredibly
              gross).<br />…Does it? Gimme a moment.<br />Hmm… I asked a few
              other Sinners about this.<br />In conclusion… The more times
              you're hit by its tongue, the deadlier the eyeball seems to be.<br />I
              couldn't figure out further details, but I think it's safe to plan
              our tactics around avoiding its tongue, manager.<br />Which is
              good. It did not feel good to get hit.<br /><span id="rodion"

              The left eye reduces health, and the right eye damages sanity.<br />So
              that's how they worked.<br />Well... Not like this changes the

              I dunno a lot about robots or machines like this...<br />Wait,
              have I...? I might have seen this one before. It was standing
              still in a room back then.<br />Right~ That souvenir robot!<br />Yeah,
              it had a panel on its chest where you could write stuff.<br />This
              thing looks like it'll chop you in half if you dared touch its
              chest, though...<br />Come to think of it, I remember running away
              from the robot because it tried to take away the thing it gave me.
              Robot arms came out clanking just like now, too.<br />Reflecting
              on it, back in my day…<br />Hah, guess it goes further back,
              actually. People much older than me used to work with hunks of
              metal like that, or so I heard.<br />If the stories are to be

              Damn, I didn't expect this of all things to get me nostalgic.<br />In
              the Backstreets, you could sometimes find toys from ages ago.<br />One
              of them was a toy crane where you grab dolls trapped behind the
              glass. You move the claw using a joystick from the outside, and
              send it down to grab whatever's underneath.<br />It was pretty
              tight. Yep.<br />And here I am... Being put in the dolls' shoes
              after all this time.<br />I sure as hell didn't see this stupid
              machine play the crane game with us!<br />And when it catches
              something, it saws the prize along the neck…<br />Ugh, talk about
              ruined childhood memories.

            <h2>Observation Level 3</h2>
            <p>
              Alright, I think I figured it out.<br />This is pretty disturbing,
              but... When it tried to grab us, we managed to dodge it one
              time.<br />After that big robot claw went upwards… Bah, sorry, I
              thought I got over it.<br />It came down again, holding
              some…machine egg thing.<br />When I got closer… I saw that the
              mechanical film was pounding to a beat.<br />Like a heart.<br />I
              know, this makes no sense normally. So don't comment stuff like "a
              heart can't beat outside an organism's systems" or whatever. You
              saw that thing move too, right?<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />I have
              to write what we did about it in full detail, huh…<br />I mean,
              what more do I say, really. We chopped that thing off.<br />The
              claw was a pretty big bother to get around, but when we cut into
              that thing somehow, that tin can stopped moving! Haha, that sure
              gave us a breather.<br />…Well, it might be because the heart
              belonged to the robot.<br />It's creepy, but whatever. It's an
              Abnormality, yeah?<br />I didn't get to spare much sympathy for
              others during the war, and I'm definitely not wasting any on
              unknown freaks like that.<br />We've got to live.

            <h2>Observation Level 1</h2>
            <p>
              Recording the information gained from an encounter with the
              entity.<br />This entity was first identified by the Preliminary
              Observation of LCC Before Team, and it was to be captured by After
              Team's Special Ops department.<br />However, it appears that we
              encountered it through the mirror before they could perform the
              task.<br />With the above-mentioned facts in consideration, I will
              describe the information gathered from Before Team's observation
              and our encounter with it in a comprehensive manner.<br />-The
              Abnormality is speculated to be a statue created as an idol for
              worship.<br />-The Abnormality appears to be floating in the air
              at all times, and shows no particular movement outside of
              gesturing with one hand.<br />-Is ■■■■ with a related Abnormality
              ■■■■■■; may suggest a connection of some kind, though details are
              unclear. [Authorization from a higher security level is required
              to access the data.]<br />-Similar to how it floats, it attacks by
              "levitating" objects and sending them flying.<br />Concluding the
              report.<br /><span id="heathcliff"
                >→ Those cleaners found it first? I thought it was their job to
                catch 'em and put 'em away?</span
              ><br /><span id="faust"
                >→ As explained before, we stand between multiple different
                possibilities via refractions. After Team may have been late in
                this possibility, or even nonexistent.</span
              ><br /><span id="heathcliff"
                >→ (A writing seems to have been scribbled out with a pen.)
                Alright, I got that loud and clear.</span
              ><br /><span id="outis">→ Someone is unconvincing.</span>
            </p>
            <h2>Observation Level 2</h2>
            <p>
              Recording the information gained from encountering the entity in
              battle.<br />I will describe its behavior during combat.<br />It
              was always accompanied by a group of followers. Observation
              suggested that they were under the influence of a type of mind
              control. The lack of any common factors shared by all followers in
              terms of attire or other external features added further
              plausibility to the speculation.<br />It appears to attack using a
              khakkhara holding spiritual significance.The staff floated in a
              similar manner to the Abnormality. It looks as though the staff
              has its own sentience.<br />Also, due to an unidentified
              interference...most attacks proved ineffective.<br />Attacks to
              the core will not achieve much until the cause is found.<br />I
              will note progress made in a future report.<br />Concluding the
              report.<br /><span id="gregor"
                >→ Wait, wait. You forgot that weird ring.</span
              ><br /><span id="sinclair"
                >→ It…gives a strange feeling. I don't know why it comes to us,
                but when it sticks to the back, it feels...strange. Like a
                pressure is weighing down on the mind…</span
              ><br /><span id="ishmael"
                >→ You had the time to feel all that? As for me, the hit I took
                while the ring was attached to me cut me in half by the waist. I
                can almost still feel it even now.</span
              ><br /><span id="sinclair"
                >→ Really…? I, I don't think I got hurt that bad.</span
              ><br /><span id="yisang"
                >→ Hm. That does remind me of the occasion when the airborne
                ring returned to me at one moment. It may be the case that there
                is a rule behind its movement.</span
              >
            </p>
            <h2>Observation Level 3</h2>
            <p>
              Recording the reason for the unsuccessful attacks.<br />Its
              followers appear to be directly linked to the Abnormality.<br />The
              Abnormality will most likely not suffer meaningful damage until
              all followers have been defeated.<br />There seems to have been a
              kind of contractual obligation that requires the followers to
              protect the Abnormality.<br />There is another discovery to
              report.<br />After its body has been broken and the head has
              fallen, it started attacking its own followers at random.<br />Although
              breaking the body was an arduous task, it proved to be quite
              effective for its suppression.<br />Concluding the report.<br /><span
                id="ishmael"
                >→ It almost looked angry, the way it moved. I guess… It was
                lashing out at its minions for failing to protect it?</span
              ><br /><span id="outis"
                >→ To think it would punish its soldiers on the front lines for
                errors in the operation. It's hardly surprising that a floating
                statue makes an incompetent commander.</span

              We engaged the entity in actual battle around 0310 hours today.
              Thus, I am writing this report to let you know of my findings.<br />The
              advice I offered earlier worked as predicted. My sincere thanks to
              you for adopting my suggestion after due consideration.<br />With
              the basket damaged, it lost its ability to replenish its
              chicken-like minions, cutting off further reinforcements.<br />While
              it may be obvious (This is of course not directed at your
              sensibilities, Executive Manager), its combat prowess was
              considerably lowered with its minions gone.<br />Though removing
              the enemy leader directly using asymmetric forces is considered an
              efficient strategy in most situations, I believe this is one of
              the cases where concentrated attacks and gradual breakdown of the

              stronger due to reasons unknown.<br />One notable difference is
              its change in form when it is enraged. In addition to the

              - Composed of steel plates with bluish rust and marks left by
              heat.<br />- Its appearance resembles that of an animal commonly
              referred to as the bull.<br />- Though the analysis isn't precise,
              the material's properties suggest it consists of an alloy of
              copper and zinc.<br />- It has another component other than steel
              plates; there appears to be a humanlike being inside it.<br />- K
              Corp's drones are flying around it. They appear to be filming
              Sinners occasionally.<br />- Though the reason or principle is
              unclear, it's thrown into a state of agitation. Because it was
              expected to make the battle more unfavorable for us as it went on,
              I suggested to the manager that the drones be destroyed first.<br />-
              The being inside constantly had a facial expression one would make
              while in pain.<br />- Its movement tends to be erratic and abrupt,
              possibly due to the pain caused by the heat.<br />- Its body is
              assumed to have intense heat. Whenever a Sinner was attacked by
              it, causalgia and burns could be observed.<br />- Clouds of gas
              assumed to be breaths or steam were observed near its head.<br />-
              It sometimes raised its body to slam a Sinner with its weight. And
              other times, from the head...the humanlike being emerged for an
              attack. Its dizzying cry left a lasting impression.<br />- When a
              Sinner was attacked by the humanlike being, they would display
              serious depression. The mental damage possibly caused them to be
              immobilized or become reluctant in combat. This effect is expected
              to be temporary.<br />- Concerned that it might render Sinners
              unable to further participate in battle, the manager has ordered
              to prioritize disabling its head. It is deemed to be an effective
              approach. The humanlike being could no longer be observed in
              battle once dealt with.<br />- No further discoveries to be made;
              the observation log is concluded.<br /><br /><span id="sinclair"

              [The paragraph below is a 'detailed description' found in a
              document left in the L Corp. branch facility located in Nest
              K.]<br />...An umbrella that may have been used to stop the rain
              once. Now, it's too old and worn to perform that role well.<br />This
              umbrella must have been the compassion for an abandoned somebody.
              But it might have come across as hollow.<br />Hypocrisy, vanity,
              irresponsibility. Those are the emotions the umbrella has harbored
              now.<br /><br />Technology liberation alliance... It is said to be
              a group of former researchers from various firms.<br /><br />There
              may yet be members in the City who we haven't met.<br /><br />Dongbaek
              seems to have been the leader of a subgroup.<br /><br />As they
              forsook the world… the world will have forsaken them in return.<br /><br />She
              has always been good at attracting like-minded individuals and
              encouraging them, so it must have been a breeze for her to gather
              the abandoned.<br /><br />How did they accept her offer, then? I
              might see the answer to that question.<br /><br />Her hand would
              have been comparable to an umbrella in a heavy rain with no
              shelter to be found, a warm gesture of compassion.<br /><br />An
              invitation to comfort and warmth.<br /><br />...Alas, the umbrella
              must be a holed one, like the one we are seeing now.<br /><br />Dongbaek
              may have held an umbrella over them... It was only a means to
              further her own interests.<br /><br />She knows it well
              herself.<br /><br />Look. See how she is helplessly caught in the
              falling rain. She must have no intention of avoiding it.<br /><br />She
              is simply showering herself and all others in the rain...<br /><br />Like
              a rusted umbrella, it would seem she has chosen to be stained in
              rust along with everything else.

              Dongbaek was rather fond of fireworks.<br /><br />It's an activity
              of entertainment where gunpowder is launched into the sky and
              blown up.<br /><br />Some of us called it an aggressive hobby and
              teased it.<br /><br />Some others joked that she might showcase a
              bomb in a future conference.<br /><br />Of course, it was all an
              innocent jest.<br /><br />However... Dongbaek must have yearned to
              see something beyond that.<br /><br />As we all did,<br /><br />She
              wished to see stars form a stream in the skies, and flowers
              blooming across the land.<br /><br />That was all there was to
              it.<br /><br />Now, the old League of Nine Littérateurs has fallen
              apart.<br /><br />As I peeked into the course of her life, I saw
              the world fall apart in a tragedy caused by technology.<br /><br />She
              must have been furious.<br /><br />She must have been consumed
              with a longing, agony, sorrow, and despair.<br /><br />As I
              was.<br /><br />All of Dongbaek's emotions have now pushed through
              the flesh, blooming into a mass of petals.<br /><br />Ahh. Are you
              stopping at last, Dongbaek?<br /><br />Only after creating an
              ideal ruination where no technology remains...<br /><br />Do you
              finally effloresce the gorgeous scenery of our hometown with your
              own body.<br /><br />I see, now I see.<br /><br />The reason you
              bloomed, sowing seeds of nostalgia, was to set your heart upon our
              new beginning.<br /><br />Dongbaek... The fireworks you used to
              love are now being recreated on the soil, as you manage to get the
              buds to bloom.<br /><br />...Indeed, it is no wonder you would be
              fond of them.

          <p>Yeah... That centipede-ish thing, right?<br><br>They call it that, but I'm not sure if it's the right name for something clad in a big chain of steel armor.<br><br>Ah, well… I guess that's what Abnormalities are like.<br><br>Alright… Starting with appearance, it looks like a huge series of blue plates of steel connected together. Kinda like a robot.<br><br>The eyes were red… and glinted sometimes.<br><br>Sometimes… No, was it actually pretty frequent? I saw sparks bounce around its body like electricity was flowing. If it's visible to the naked eye, that's gotta mean the voltage is pretty high... It won't just sting when it touches you, that's for sure.<br><br>→ Centipede… To me, it looked more like a snake. It coiled up at kept glaring.<br><br>→ Fair point, but… Did snakes have legs where you lived? You can't call that one a snake.<br><br>→ They do, though?<br><br>→ There are legged snakes.<br><br>→ Oh, I saw 'em, too.<br><br>→ ...Am I the odd one out?<br><br>→ You're so funny, darling~</p>
         <h2>Observation Level 2</h2>
          <p>Haah... Electrocution was not what we should've been worrying about.<br><br>I described it as wearing some steel armor, didn't I? I've gotta correct it; rather than armor, it was more like... blades sharpened on all sides covering its body.<br><br>Imagine it stabbing, pushing... even coiling around us with that kind of body. It did a number on the Sinners.<br><br>We were all bleeding ourselves dry as we fought...<br><br>That doesn't mean it had nothing to do with electricity. It looked like it had to stop whatever it was doing and coil itself up in order to shock us.<br><br>No wonder it was like that when we first faced it...<br><br>Well, I guess that means it has one clear weakness.<br><br>Once its head was smashed in, it couldn't coil up any more... That has to mean no more electrocutions, right?<br><br><span id="ishmael">→ Excuse me, Gregor. I trusted you and charged ahead only to be fried to char. What do you have to say about this?</span><br><br>→ I can attest to that. Her discolored hair resembled a spoiled broccoli. I would eat no such thing as an orange broccoli even in battle.<br><br><span id="ishmael">→ ...If you have a problem with my hair, say it directly.</span><br><br><span id="gregor">→ W-Whoa, there... Cool it down. Look, I'm sorry about what happened... Who could have thought breaking the head would make electricity flow througb its whole body?</span></p>
         <h2>Observation Level 3</h2>
          <p>Did you know...? Apparently, centipedes' nerves stay active and go wild for a good while even after their heart stops beating.<br><br>This one's the same.<br><br>Seems to be some kind of final struggle... We got lax, but then the rich buddy got killed.<br><br>Faust said, 'Since nerves are activated by electric stimuli, this may be an electric problem.'<br><br>Well... She added that 'Although there is no guarantee such logic still stands with Abnormalities.' But I disagree with her there.<br><br>When we broke its head last time, I noticed something... At least, this guy has got to be following some laws that make sense. We already saw short circuits and electric currents work with it, right?<br><br>If that's the case... If we wait for it to run out of power... It'll go down on its own.<br><br>See if I'm right, will ya?</p>

          <p>Hmm... How do I put it...<br><br>My first impression of it was, pitiful... and poor.<br><br>It looked like a huge wolf... no, fox, actually. It looked at us and growled.<br><br>On its body... old umbrellas were stuck on it. Not one, several of them.<br><br>It doesn't look like they were left by someone trying to attack it... If that were the case, the sharp parts would've been lodged into its body first.<br><br>I wonder why the handles of the umbrellas were stuck in it.<br><br>It seemed to be extremely wary of us.

Like my own heart is breaking...<br><br>That's how it feels.<br><br><span id="faust">→ Sinclar, what you're experiencing is simple loss of sanity during battle.

         <h2>Observation Level 3</h2>
          <p>Ah... I finally realized it.<br><br>The fox was mad at those who only give it meaningless attention before leaving.<br><br>Looking at the poor, abandoned thing on the street and giving it nothing but an umbrella...<br><br>People who gave it such meager care and think themselves as gracious benefactors for it, feeding their own ego...<br><br>That's what the fox was sad and angry about.<br><br>I, I see where it's coming from.<br><br>We have to take away the worn umbrellas on that poor child, and embrace it ourselves. We-<br><br>→ Didn't have a choice here. Seemed like something he could only snap out of after dying. (Trails of blood can be seen on the log.)<br><br>→ Although the method was rather extreme...

            <p>Well...

            <p>Cor, why is it so bloody sticky... (A substance that seems to be yellow glue are smidged around this part.)<br><br>I bet this bugger would've posted flyers in the Backstreets for a living if it were a human... doing nothing but that for years, I guarantee you.<br><br>It put several talismans over my body before I could notice. Dammit...<br><br>Not sure if it was those creepy pieces of paper pissing me off, but it felt a bit like the bat was working better. Whatever it was, it didn't feel like a bad thing.<br><br>Oh, and the talismans on its body moved to my bat, too. Don't know how it works, but... I guess they wrapped around it.<br><br>Anyway, this thing bugs me more the more I hit it.

This is just like that...<br><br>Hngh... I guess I got really streesed out. I'm feeling a bit dizzy, too...<br><br>I'll stop here for now. Sorry, Dante~<br><br>→ Is she drunk?<br><br>→ Impossible.

            <p>Sorry~ I was a bit messy with my last log.<br><br>I asked Fau if I can erase it and write a new one, but she said I absolutely can't. Isn't she a meanie?<br><br>Anyway... It did help with figuring some stuff out, so I hope you'll show some forgivenss.<br><br>Here's what I can tell for sure: those bits of jelly that fly around as we fight boost our morale.<br><br>And, the boost gets more powerful as the battle goes on.<br><br>When someone whose morale is at its highest... I mean, like MAX! Kinda highest... breaks the glass of booze~<br><br>Bingo! That person gets super drunk right away!<br><br>Once someone got drunk, their attacks would get weaker and miss a lot more easily.<br><br>And here's the catch~ The fatty jelly fella gobbled up one of our drunk pals once, right?

            <h2>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ACTIVATED</h2>
            Enjoying yourselves Intruders?<br /><br />
            It's worth knowing the cataclysmic damage you will be responsible
            for today.<br /><br />
            Do not fool yourselves. This facility is not simply the fruitless
            work of some pathetic scientist;<br /><br />
            this house was built by the genius Clovis Bray I himself. Within
            lies humanity's salvation: 'La Fountaine de Jouvence', made possible
            by Clarity Control. <br /><br />Magnificent wasn't it? An entity
            from beyond our own dimension, and the answer to humanity's eternal
            struggle: Mortality. <br /><br />Were it fall into the wrong hands,
            humanity and the universe would be utterly doomed. <br /><br />I
            have no reason to believe you are anything other than the wrong
            hands. <br /><br />You now face Godlike Judgement, may it extend
            eternally.
