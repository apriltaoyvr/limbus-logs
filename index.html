            The wheel has often been the symbol of technological advancement.<br />It
            represents humanity's realization of its ability to think up and
            actualize things that weren't in the nature.<br />At the same time,
            it marks the beginning of humanity's transformation into prideful
            creatures.<br />That might be why pride takes the form of a
            wheel.<br />The steel circle doesn't ever seem to stop rotating.<br />It
            doesn't care if it gashes at flesh or crushes patches of grass.<br />Because,
            it can roll…<br />While others cannot.

            It happened while I was passing by a jungle.<br>It was a dense green wilderness full of tall flowers and trees, as well as outlandish bees and butterflies.<br>You can find all kinds of unfathomably strange creatures in a place like that.<br>For example... That flower.<br>It's said that a plant can't normally move on its own. One it takes root, it stays there for the rest of its life.<br>That's what people consider a major difference between plants and animals.<br>But those "plants" were like a pack of rabid beasts.<br>A group of them charged at us, raising their teethed flowers like it was their head.<br>Their roots morphed into limbs that no longer serve the original purpose, and there didn't seem to be any space in their bodies for storing nutrients.<br>Yet, those scrawny stems were hungrily seeking the missing sustenance.<br>Continuously shoving things into the mouth, despite being unable to absorb any of it...<br>What an odd creature that was.

            It resembled a rock.<br>I am uncertain how an object of its mass is able to move. Its appearance could not be any less adherent to laws of science, but when I look back, it might have been an inherently scientific object after all.<br>It would levitate in the air and stay still.<br>It rolled its eyeball lodged in the center. And when it felt like it, it would ram into some persons.<br>I am not yet sure what motivates it to move. Even so, I wonder if it's necessary to learn its reasons at all.<br>It's possible that this pebble is alive.<br>No one would call it an organism, but by the same token, I may not be alive if no one refers to me as such.<br>Perhaps it was simply a matter of laziness.<br>We were lazy to think that it mustn't be what it thought to be.<br>That pebble is probably a lazy living being.<br>And the same could be said of me.

            You want me to talk about that pointed thing, aye?<br>Thing's shaped like a dried tentacle... There was some kind of red liquid in the middle.<br>Smacked it a couple times with my bat, and the lanky thing was a bit more durable it seemed.<br>Bigger problem, though... That thing's got a weird way of attacking.<br>It prods poor sods with its long snout, and... It starts shooting that red water into the body!<br>It gives me a heartburn like I had some hard stuff on an empty stomach... 's irritating...and suffocating...<br>A-Anyway, it makes you feel all weird. Makes you mad over wee stuff.<br>Some even blew up after getting hit by that juice. I really don't want that happening to me.<br>→ Weren't you always prone to getting mad over the smallest things?<br>→ Don't piss me off.

            -An insect-like entity with a transparent body.<br>-Unable to identify several physical requirements for maintenance of life; cannot determine it as an organism.<br>-Its body is filled with water.<br>-Objects that appear to be organs are observed inside, but they do not appear to function as organs.<br>-The water does not appear to play any part in biological activities, either.<br>-The body of liquid appears to be stagnant.<br>-It has the face of someone lost deep in thought. It could merely be a resemblance to a species of zooplankton.<br>-Prolonged observation makes my mind sink.<br>-Sinking… Reminding me of the past.<br>-…It is not a pleasant feeling.

            Those look like awful lumps of flesh...<br>Has an ugly maw at the front... I thought it was a tongue at first, but what's inside that maw was a hand.<br>A hand, made from two twisted arms coiling around each other. I saw the eye inside stare into me.<br>As if that wasn't enough, it looked eager to devour me and nourish its flesh.<br>Even if I couldn't hear it, I could tell.<br>...It wasn't the first time I saw that kind of gaze.
