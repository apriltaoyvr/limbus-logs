And other times, from the head...the humanlike being emerged for an attack. Its dizzying cry left a lasting impression.\n- When a Sinner was attacked by the humanlike being, they would display serious depression. The mental damage possibly caused them to be immobilized or become reluctant in combat.

They were all pink, same as the ribbon wrapped around the body.\nOh, speaking of ribbons, doesn't it bear a striking resemblance to silk?\nI think our family kept a similar color of fabric. Though it wasn't the most luxurious... Hm, I do guess it's valuable in its own right.\nRight, that's it! We used something like this for decoration on our younger sibling's birthday! ",

To elaborate, that is the precise time when we identified it as an enemy and prepared for battle.\nIts appearance is akin to a hideous, ancient tree. I estimate its age to be easily over 100 years old. I raise its broad wrinkles and wide pillar as supporting evidence.\nWhat was odd, however, was that its height was far too stocky despite its aforementioned traits.\nIts twisting branches all point to a singular direction, and clues indicate that its roots are broad and deep-reaching…\nAfter a thorough observation of the blue fairy(I’m unsure if this is an appropriate designation for it, but I was unable to find another suitable name), which hangs from the tip of one of the branches and radiates a bright light,\nI concluded that this is a trap contingent on deception.\nSuch deceptive traps were often used in numerous battles I have participated in. Install something to draw the attention of your enemies and ambush them from where they least expect… It’s a rather rudimentary trap.\nI have ordered the Sinners to halt their advance and await the Executive Manager’s orders.\nPlease consult this guide in your future commands.\nThank you.",

A critical issue arose after an extended battle.\nOnce there were no smaller Fairies to cannibalize, the queen entity became frenzied, unable to find a way to sate its hunger. The destructive power behind its strikes grew by multiple magnitudes as well.\nA swift retreat was our only option, as it was determined that we could not recover from that particular blow. It can be determined that a prolonged battle will not be in our favor; we must find a way to suppress the entity quickly.\nConcluding the report.",

However, we have also identified various additional attack patterns from the entity.\nUsing the information gathered in the previous encounter, the Sinners did not attack the smaller Fairies, preventing the larger entity from cannibalizing them.\nHowever, repeated use of that strategy invariably led to the queen growing frenzied, clearly unable to withstand its hunger.\nAnother, previously unidentified element in this battle has also been observed.\nAs the battle continued, we noticed that smaller Fairy entities would sometimes join the battle. Perhaps this can be attributed to the existence of a colony that we have yet to discover.\nAlthough we were unable to confirm whether they were a permanent addition to the battle, the conclusion remains the same: a prolonged battle will be to our disadvantage.

Speeding up time like the T Corp. employees do, rapidly healing his wounds by accelerating the recovery process...\nThe most interesting thing in his arsenal, though, was the Time Razor he cut me with at the Clock Tower. It can cut straight through time while leaving the flesh intact. I wonder how that works?\nI carefully listened to the Time Rippers talk amongst one another, but I don't think they knew either. I guess I did learn that the deeper they cut, the more time they can take, but that's about it.\nThankfully, the Razor didn't seem to affect me one bit because I was bound to the manager's time.

Well, I suppose we'll all be okay as long as Dante's safe and sound!\nOh, also... he didn't hoard all that ripped time to himself, either.\nAfter we closed the case, I asked some people in T Corp., and they told me that he embraced the brains of those who agreed with his philosophy. He always shared everything equally among themselves, whether it was the time they ripped or the time they had to spend.\nOhh, that explains why the Rippers were able to move independently from the main body. It looked as though they had fused into a single Distortion... but in truth, they each retained their own intelligence.\nAnd this is just my guess, but maybe his experience in the Yurodiviye influenced how his Distortion manifested?\nThat makes me wonder if this is a distorted, degraded form of the belief that things should be shared equally...\nWell, all in all, it didn't seem to have worked out~ It would've been a much harder fight if they actually managed to divide the time equally amongst one another. I'd say we got lucky!\nThough I guess you could also say that they were bound to eventually fall apart, given the fact that they ended up fighting each other towards the end.",

He kept throwing more and more lassos, and every time he did… he grew increasingly accurate.  He even started throwing two lassos at the same time, without a single miss, too!  Ah, but he had a hard time avoiding our attacks because he was so focused on throwing his lassos.  That makes me wonder, though. Why didn't he just run off once he had all of us in snares?  Maybe he wasn't exactly looking to capture us?  Then, maybe his purpose was to wear us down as soon as possible so he could leave here.  And if that was his purpose… I wonder what he was trying to capture with that thorny lasso?  I'd like to ask him if we can meet again. ",

Rude, rough… but never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that she was a Bloodfiend.\nAll because she didn’t want to die… honestly, I get it. I really do.\nI’ve seen enough folks during the war, surrendering to the enemy for that very same reason.\nBut surrendering was rarely ever better than continuing to fight. Without someone or something major to back them up, to vouch for them… they’d just get executed.\nMaybe… maybe that’s why I can’t bring myself to condemn her choice like Don Quixote does. Because I've seen people like her with my own eyes.\n... Of course, that’s that, and this is this.\nIf it's between her life or my escape, I'll choose to be selfish. Spending thousands of years trapped inside this train, doing nothing? No, that’s such a ridiculous idea that I don’t even want to think about it.\nBy the way, do you know what else is ridiculous? Suddenly getting woken up in the middle of an active WARP trai— Fine, I’ll move on.\nAnyways… though red crystals were poking through her prosthetic body, she continued to function at a decent capacity.\nShe still uses the same, familiar prosthetic fighting style: suddenly raising her power output or using the prosthetic parts as disposable shields.\nAnd… let’s see… Right. Don’t let her cut you, because you’ll be bleeding from that wound for a while.\nI felt her weapons, covered in some serrated, crystallized sawblades, rip my skin apart. But I don’t think there was much more to her than that.\nThe biggest threat she posed was her ability to regenerate almost infinitely, thanks to the train’s weird environment.

    "text": "- No meaningful distinguishing features could be identified when comparing this entity to sub-entities of other Abnormalities.  - Their exteriors, while partially hinging on the host's original appearance, share the following commonalities: bodies bound by vines and a flower bloomed upon their heads.  - Upon corrosion of the hosts, the following symptoms could be observed: major loss of rationality and a constant yearning for blood.  - However, another observed aspect of this corroded state is that their consciousness is not completely lost, and a rudimentary level of communication could be established.  - In the case of corroded humans, transformation into a state similar to that of ravenous Bloodfiends could be observed; it was also observed that corroded humans' ability to maintain consciousness was relatively diminished compared to corroded Bloodfiends(however, due to the small sample size, contradictory findings may be present in future research).  - In the case of Bloodfiends, uncorroded subjects have also demonstrated the blood-craving characteristic. It appears that the long period of starvation lowers their ability to rationalize.  - Thus, a deeper level of observation of study is required to determine the distinguishing factors between ravenous Bloodfiends and rose-corroded Bloodfiends.  - Will note new discoveries in a future report.",

While the possibility that the subject may have held the title of a ‘Prince’ is non-zero, various responses and the records of attempted conversation suggest that the subject was involved in a form of stageplay prior to boarding the WARP train.\nFurther attempts at communication resulted in a hostile encounter.\nDuring the hostile encounter, the subject used crystallized blood to summon a powerful weapon in his hands. Similar observational records have been identified in ■■■■■, as characteristics of [Authorization from a higher security level is required to access the data.]’s child Kindreds.\nIn the same vein, the said weapon has been identified to have exceptional levels of hardness, strength, and sharpness. The damages inflicted by this weapon were observed to be significantly more severe than those caused by standard weapons.\nThis matches the data from [Authorization from a higher security level is required to access the data.], conducted and collected based on observation of ■■■■■.\nThe subject absorbed blood stored in his Bloodbags.

    "text": "We engaged with the entity in a meaningful capacity around 1100 hours today.  Its first actions in battle were to attempt to strike us physically using its bones. Just as we had expected.  Its most prominent form of attack involved extending its spine to maul its foes with its sizable jaws. However, another, unexpected form of attack was also observed.  It intermittently lets out a breath. The exhale carried an extraordinary level of shock and air pressure that dealt rather significant damage to any Sinners who were caught directly in its blast radius.  Our allies are far from the most reliable martial force, but a numerical disadvantage may easily lead to fatal results; please do take this advice into account.  However… it does not seem that this entity requires a high level of strategizing to defeat. Maintaining high pressure should be more than enough.  Another thing to keep in mind: after some time, it released a large volume of ‘air’ by exhaling.  The ‘air’ seemed to improve the poise of whomever breathed it in, enhancing the keenness of their attacks. This is when the shadow entity within the skull began to mobilize, attempting to steal the ‘air’ from all those who had it.  Various strategies were attempted to stop this process, but they were to no avail.  The most optimal, and the only strategy against losing this air would be to ensure that every unit individually resist the entity to the best of their abilities.  The entity’s attacks became highly augmented once it inhaled a large volume of this air; preventing this outcome must be the primary objective of this battle.  Concluding the report.  Thank you.",
